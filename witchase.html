					<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="process-info col-sm-9">
					<p>WitChase is a 2D mobile game designed for Android tablets and it focuses on crafting and combing items. This game features avatar-based gameplay centered around fulfilling requests made by non player characters (NPC) and the game is played by gathering and crafting new items. The main character is called Eithne who is a witch going on a journey to defeat the evil villain through exploring and crafting magical items. By fulfilling the NPCs' requests, Eithne then will be able to proceed to the next level, advancing closer to find out what happened to the people in her village.</p>

					<h4>Gameplay</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="process-info col-sm-9">
					<p>Each level will be designed as different areas within the villain’s territory. The player’s mission is to explore, discover, collect and craft new elements within the gameworld to solve the puzzle to complete the level.</p>

					<h4>Mechanics</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="process-info col-sm-9">
					<p>The core mechanics revolve around the movement and crafting system.  The primary mechanics of the crafting system include collecting items and combining them into new forms of items. Within the gameworld, there will be primary elements where the player can collect only once. To complete one level, player may be required to collect an item several times. These items must be collected and crafted in chronological order in order to complete the mission for proceeding to the next level. As for the movement, player has the option to move and climb around the game world to explore and discover the existence of a new item. </p>

					<h4>Game World</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="process-info col-sm-9">
					<p>Our team decided to create a clear structural gameworld where players complete a level and proceed to the next game section. The concept of each gameworld is designed based on the environments where the player has to bypass before arriving the villain’s palace. For instance, a forest with magic portal and the gate area in front of the palace. Within each level game world there are primary items where player may interact, terrains and platforms, and a unique form of portal to transport player forward the palace.</p>

					<h4>Summary</h4>

				<div class="process-info col-sm-9">
					<p>This was a five-members team project. Our team underwent a significant amount of discussion on iterating and refining our ideas on gameplay and level design. Later we transformed our game and design ideas into digital formats, such as icons, character, NPCs, background and interfaces and gradually built up our game prototypes.</p>
